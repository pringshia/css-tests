      So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to
      McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely scrambled part of Cicero's De
      Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a
      type specimen book.
    </p><p>
      It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made
      it popular as a dummy text in the 1960s, although McClintock says he
      remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal
      type samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage,
      but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th century supports the theory that
      the filler text has been used for centuries.

      And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts
      supply houses were hiring classics scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it
      seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far before the
      age of Letraset.
